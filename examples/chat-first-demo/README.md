  rubric 2 独立复核同一次历史运行：确定性 fail/66、真实 Judge fail/32。
- 修复后：Mem0 OFF 时本地与会话工具均读到 1 条确认记忆；真实 Judge pass/92，
  总体 needs_review/71，因缺少 Wiki/会话材料不能称为完整交付。
- 本机录制不是网站实时执行，不证明 Mem0、WeKnora、Langfuse 已连接。
- 下载 JSON 只导出已审查的合成录制，不含密钥、隐藏推理、电话、邮箱或完整工具正文。

证据源：`../../docs/testing/fixtures/agent-services-real-2026-10-03.json`。
新的浏览器实测见 `../../docs/testing/agent-services-real-run-2026-10-03.md`。

This is a standalone, buildless browser example. Open `dist/index.html` through any ordinary static file server. It does not start the real Next.js CRM, Supabase, an agent worker, a model, or a messaging integration. All customers, prices, dates, approvals and local tasks are fictional.

## Optional Agent services: source-aligned preview

Source baseline: `12749abaa8aa98f7bee988f69fb4aa23e9d5ff29` on `feat/chat-first-workbench-2026-10-01`.

The existing **AI 提供商 → Agent 服务接入** page now shows Mem0, WeKnora and Langfuse as OFF / NOT CONNECTED. All service enable/retry and credential-entry controls are disabled. The **服务接入** button in Agent chat opens five source-linked panels, including the recorded real-model comparison. Customer detail has its own contact-scoped memory panel.

- Configuration shows the real server-only binding fields, configuration versus connectivity boundary, required migrations, admin activation, isolated delivery lane and cleanup limitations
- Customer-memory scenarios require explicit confirmation, then illustrate pending, synced, unknown-write settlement and local deletion redaction. They are in-memory scenarios, not API responses. A different contact cannot inherit the form or records
- Wiki scenarios require the fictional allow-list, whole-organization visibility confirmation, source registration and Agent publication before showing evidence. Stale or revoked sources hide excerpts and manifests
- Trace is an implementation mapping, with no made-up timings, tokens or real trace IDs. A separate terminal-Run scenario illustrates the explicit deterministic Eval save entry without pretending to persist or export a score

These additions use only fictional data. No new state is persisted; reload or Reset returns all service scenarios to defaults. No key, credential, connector grant, vendor deployment, model call or private-data export occurs. Existing Runtime Lab persistence is unchanged. The real CRM adapters are source code, not running services in this Site.

The actual repository uses Next.js, Supabase/PostgreSQL, a separate worker and scheduler; this Site is configured for static assets. Sites can also publish Cloudflare-compatible Workers, but no supported Worker build or equivalent full CRM backend configuration is present here. Converting the database/auth/worker/vendor stack is outside this preview update. No database migrations or live vendor acceptance were run. The production verification report is `docs/testing/agent-services-2026-10-02.md` at the immutable baseline above.

Mapped sources: `components/ai/AgentIntegrationsPanel.tsx`, `components/ai/CustomerMemoryPanel.tsx`, `app/api/v1/ai/integrations/route.ts`, `app/api/v1/ai/integrations/wiki/sources/route.ts`, `app/app/ai/workbench/_components/AgentCrmWorkbench.tsx`, and `lib/ai/integrations/{config,mem0,weknora,langfuse}.ts`.

## Modern neutral visual refresh

The shared visual contract now uses a white working surface, `#F7F8FA` canvas, `#F9FAFB` lightweight sidebar, `#1D1D1F` text, `#6E6E73` secondary text, and `#E5E7EB` dividers. System sans-serif typography, 12px controls, 16px cards, and a 20px composer replace the earlier dense warm/graphite treatment. Primary actions are charcoal; blue is reserved for links, focus, and information states. Source-code inspection, local Runtime Lab, safety labels, 62 routes, and all existing interactions remain intact. The production application's tenant branding is independent and is not overwritten by this standalone example.

`dist/modern.css` is the final visual layer. Supporting CSS has also been neutralized so the local laboratory and older screens stay consistent. The fixed chat composer, keyboard/IME behavior, mobile navigation, content overflow boundaries, safe areas, and reduced-motion rules are retained. `tests/visual-style.cjs` checks CSS property grammar, theme tokens, text contrast and 320/390/768/1440 DOM scenarios. It does not claim pixel rendering or real-device keyboard verification.

## Inspect the current production-code changes

Click **更新检查 · 12749ab** in the toolbar, **证据与版本** in Agent chat, or **检查本次更新** in the welcome area. This opens an inspection drawer alongside the retained chat-first UI. All its data is synthetic and explicitly separate from the current simulated chat Run.

The inspection drawer is mapped to production feature commit `12749abaa8aa98f7bee988f69fb4aa23e9d5ff29` on `feat/chat-first-workbench-2026-10-01`:

- Knowledge evidence shows current, superseded and revoked-source examples, with exact synthetic source/index/chunk JSON. Revocation hides the excerpt rather than retaining a historical permission grant
- Organization memory demonstrates a resumed turn reading a newer published revision; the customer checkpoint is read-only and bounded by organization, contact, conversation, service revision and demanda revision. Unavailable/empty/changed or anonymized-contact examples never expose the previous checkpoint
- Eval shows all seven production dimension labels and individual reason/code examples. A missing-material state refuses to display a score. It does not run the production evaluator or semantic Judge
- Mission customer-send controls require a reason and update the same existing local demo Mission. Investigation remains available. Pausing expires pending/approved local proposal state; resuming does not revive it. Completed Missions do not expose the control. This is not general Run pause or external sending
- Code/configuration links are immutable and spell out model, embeddings, indexing, source permissions, memory, workers and channel prerequisites. The historical model report remains pinned to its original `fc80b14` reference

`inspection.js` is an independent inspection adaptation, not a compiled React Workbench or proof of the real API response. Publishing the Site does not start Next.js, Supabase, the agent worker, or any provider. Refresh resets the inspection examples and ordinary CRM state; only the existing lab has browser persistence.

## Use the laboratory

1. Click **能力实验室** in the toolbar (or the Agent chat welcome area).
2. Start **完整链路**. Use **执行下一步** to inspect each operation, or **运行至下一关卡** to stop at a human decision.
3. View retrieved Wiki sources and citations. Current price v3 supersedes the old v2 price; other-organization sources are filtered out.
4. Inspect memory v1/v2 and the deliberately stale write that is rejected. Pause, reload the page and resume from the checkpoint.
5. Approve the local follow-up task. The first commit deliberately fails; retry reuses the same task identity.
6. Inspect the seven computed Eval assertions, open the associated trace event, and review the unsent cited draft. Run completion is separate from simulated business acceptance.
7. Try **缺少 Wiki** to observe blocking and recovery, and **错误主张** to see Eval reject a fabricated `won` assertion against an observed `open` lead.

The laboratory uses a fixed quote-review workflow. Editable task text is saved as context; it is not interpreted by a language model. Run/step controls are intentional, not an endless animated tour. Replay reads existing events without re-executing them. Reset deletes only this laboratory's storage key. Trace export produces a local JSON file, not an upload.

## What actually executes here

- Deterministic keyword matching and sorting over published, active, same-organization fixture sources
- Versioned local memory snapshots and an explicit expected-version conflict check
- A checkpointed task state machine with pause, manual approval, an injected retryable error and idempotent local task creation
- Runtime-collected timestamps, operation inputs/outputs, elapsed timings and source locators
- Explicit deterministic evaluation functions, including a deliberately failing control scenario
- Browser `localStorage` save/restore, with an honest memory-only fallback if storage is unavailable

This is local execution of a new fixture engine. It is not a deployment or execution of the production RAG, org-memory, queue, SQL/RLS or evaluator code. Local filtering does not establish production tenant isolation. Browser persistence is not server durability, a distributed queue, cross-device synchronization or worker crash recovery. Clearing browser storage loses the progress.

The production repository has immutable organization-memory versions and a current pointer. The lab's customer-scoped snapshots and `expectedVersion` conflict rejection are illustrative lab protections, not a claim that the current production memory publication API implements that concurrency contract.

No application script invokes a model API, HTTP transport, customer-send worker, external CDN, telemetry or credential form. Model/provider are `null`, tokens are not applicable, and model/service spend is USD 0 because none is called. This does not estimate hosting or browser costs. Source links open GitHub only when selected by the visitor.

## Evidence provenance

The **本次 Trace** panel shows events actually executed by this local fixture engine. It is prominently labeled non-LLM. It includes complete local inputs and outputs, not hidden reasoning.

The separate **历史模型证据** panel contains minimized factual excerpts from the already-committed report:

- Repository: `helsome/AiNativeCrm`
- Inspected production reference: `fc80b14dc88406ab6f5e6ec3ed9ca61d632c0674`
- Report: `docs/testing/multi-agent-eval-real-run-2026-09-28.md`
- Recorded model: `opencode / space-bunny-free`, date 2026-09-28
- Reported final result: `needs_review / 87`; no grounded Wiki evidence

The report was read, not re-executed or independently validated against its database in this task. Full original event JSON is not committed with that report; the viewer does not invent missing per-tool inputs/outputs or present the summary as a complete raw trace. Customer text and internal reasoning are excluded. The reported Judge tokens are explicitly only that Judge invocation; currency cost was not recorded and remains unknown. A model name containing `free` is not treated as historical billing proof.

The golden corpus (`tests/agent-runtime/fixtures/workbench-eval-golden.ts` in the main repo) combines real-run-derived minimized fixtures with synthetic regression cases. Those are not treated as unmodified raw traces. No new LLM trace is synthesized or mislabeled.

The fictional Starbridge scenario matches `docs/design/llm-wiki-example/` on the same branch. Its source IDs, policy versions and customer requests are illustrative, not real CRM object locators. The production-source links in the lab point to immutable inspected files and describe the gap between the production capability and this local adaptation.

## Existing interface preserved

All 62 render targets, 55 catalog entries, 15 direct sidebar links and four hubs remain. Existing Agent chat keeps its viewport-height work area and non-shrinking composer, multi-turn simulated conversation, Enter/Shift+Enter and IME handling, inspect/act mode, context drawer, approval/undo and Mission controls. The laboratory is a separate accessible overlay with keyboard tabs and focus restoration; closing it returns to the same CRM page.

The navigation/palette adaptation originated at `a891934a2c894d55c29fdd2a085268f391e3e4b5`; Agent delegation behavior was checked at the production reference above. This standalone example is not a pixel-exact production build. Other CRM pages remain ordinary UI simulations whose state resets on refresh; only the laboratory has browser persistence.

## Test

From this example directory, install its two development dependencies and run:

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

The engine-only suite needs no installed packages:

```sh
npm run test:engine
```

`JSDOM_PATH` and `CSS_TREE_PATH` can optionally point at an existing installation of the pinned packages. Tests resolve ordinary package names by default; no personal filesystem paths are required.

- `smoke.cjs`: retained CRM/Agent/Mission state behavior
- `full-smoke.cjs`: 62 routes, navigation, handlers, state transitions and generated route coverage
- `chat-dom.cjs`: real DOM interaction, conversation turns, keyboard/IME, escaping, drawer focus, delegation, cancellation and CSS parsing
- `runtime-lab.cjs`: executable engine, all workflow gates, reload checkpoints, no duplicate tasks, missing-Wiki recovery, failure control, reset isolation and evidence provenance
- `inspection-dom.cjs`: code-aligned new panels, source withdrawal/staleness, customer boundary redaction, Eval missing-material refusal, scoped pause/resume and expired approvals, source provenance, focus, 62-route entry preservation and zero HTTP transport
- `agent-services-dom.cjs`: default-off/not-connected provider states, disabled credential controls, no transport or persistence, contact-scoped confirmation/sync/settlement/delete scenarios, Wiki authorization/publish/revalidation gates, Trace mapping and terminal-only Eval scenario, 62 routes, reset/reload, keyboard and responsive DOM checks
- `runtime-lab-dom.cjs`: real DOM workflow/reload/reset, trace/evidence/replay controls, provenance display, keyboard tabs/focus, transport-call tripwires and responsive CSS containment

These tests use deterministic Node and jsdom harnesses, not a live browser rendering engine. Responsive/mobile CSS is parsed and structurally asserted, but this does not verify pixel layout, touch scrolling or a real phone keyboard. Browser screenshot QA was not run: the task environment had a previously verified browser-process/preview limitation, and no alternate route was used to bypass it. No live model, live CRM backend, complete root unit suite or production queue recovery test is claimed.

## Architecture boundary

This example is isolated infrastructure/demo code. It does not replace any core CRM route or remove a shipped capability. Input: fictional customer requirements and human controls. Output: visible trace, draft, internal fixture task and separate business state. Failures become visible blockers; retry and source repair change subsequent execution. There is no external action or production persistence to migrate.

## Real API implementation after this demo

See [the real-runtime capability and setup matrix](../../docs/design/crm-real-api-parity-2026-10-01.md).
The production path now shares versioned organization memory across initial/resumed model turns,
reads conversation-bound customer checkpoints, retains actual RAG chunk/index provenance, shows
re-authorized observed evidence and computed Eval reasons, and exposes Mission customer-send
pause/resume. The lab's generic whole-workflow pause, arbitrary customer-memory CAS, business-policy
validity/supersession fixtures and raw local JSON export still have different production semantics.
A chat-model Key alone does not provision embeddings, indexed sources, workers or customer channels.
